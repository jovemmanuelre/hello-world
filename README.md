# hello-world
This is my first attempt at tech and law.
I'm Jov. I live in the Philippines.
I currently work at the Philippine Government as an Executive Assistant.
However, I graduated with a degree in Legal Management, and would like to practice my degree.
I am aware that I need to upskill myself in order to get career opportunities in law today, hence this activity.
I aim to learn the fundamentals and essentials of this platform that I can use to improve my skills in tech.
I believe this would open opportunities law and tech.
This would also help me become globally competent and participate in today's game.
I am thrilled to learn but I'm scared because I'm not yet convinced that I have the patience and the focus to learn everything from square one.
Thank you for this opportunity to learn.
